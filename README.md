# PayStubGen

A small practice program. Trying to build a PayStub generator. It would function as a punch-in and punch-out and at your choice you could see a report with all the punch-ins, punch-outs and tell you your gross revenue, using a provided rate. Really simple. 

Internally, I want it to use design patterns and use the MVC architecture as a foundation for the application.
